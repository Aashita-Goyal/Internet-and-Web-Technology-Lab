        The
        <strong><u>Internet</u></strong>
        , sometimes called simply "
        <strong><u>the Net</u></strong>
        ," is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network of networks
        in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get
        information from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to
        users at other computers). It was conceived by the Advanced Research
        Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969 and was first
        known as the
        <strong><u>ARPANet</u></strong>
        . The original aim was to create a network that would allow users of a
        research computer at one university to "talk to" research computers at
        other universities. A side benefit of ARPANet's design was that, because
        messages could be routed or rerouted in more than one direction, the
        network could continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in
        the event of a military attack or other disaster.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, the Internet is
        a public, cooperative and self-sustaining facility accessible to
        hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is used by many as the
        primary source of information consumption, and fueled the creation and
        growth of its own social ecosystem through social media and content
        sharing. Furthermore, e-commerce, or online shopping, has become one of
        the largest uses of the Internet.

        Physically, the Internet uses a portion of the total resources of the
        currently existing public telecommunication networks. Technically, what
        distinguishes the Internet is its use of a set of protocols called
        Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Two recent
        adaptations of Internet technology, the intranet and the extranet, also
        make use of the
        <strong><u>TCP/IP</u></strong>
        protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Internet can be seen
        as having two major components: network protocols and hardware. The
        protocols, such as the TCP/IP suite, present sets of rules that devices
        must follow in order to complete tasks. Without this common collection
        of rules, machines would not be able to communicate.
