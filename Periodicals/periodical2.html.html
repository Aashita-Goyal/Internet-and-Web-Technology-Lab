	    Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks 
		that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between 
		networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private,
		public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, 
		linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 
		The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the 
		inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail,
		telephony, and file sharing.

		Most traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and 
		newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new
		services such as email, Internet telephony, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, 
		and video streaming websites. Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website
		technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators.
